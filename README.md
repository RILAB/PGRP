### Status

Declined by NSF 12/2014. [Panel reviews](https://github.com/RILAB/PGRP/blob/master/reviews2014.md) were generally positive, with overall summary "highly meritorious."

Suggested changes for next time: clarify phenotyping/RNAseq, target audience of outreach, remove teosinte, note drawbacks.

Up for debate: remove teosinte (as suggested by reviewers)?, reduce overall budget?, Hufford as PI?
