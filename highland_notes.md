Highland maize is characterized by (i) highly pubescent, often purple stems, (ii) drooping, leathery leaves, (iii) weak roots, (iv) tassels with few branches, and (v) conical-shaped ears

### Stats

- Worldwide 8% of all maize growing area is tropical highland
- 6M ha world total highland maize
- 46% of maize in Tanzania is highland maize

#[Root Lodging](http://repository.cimmyt.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10883/742/63386.pdf?sequence=1)

People knowledgeable about Mexican highland maize genotypes know that the greatest weakness of this material is its susceptibility to root lodging. Mexican farmers long ago recognized this problem and try to cope with it by routinely "hilling up" highland maize three times during the vegetative stage. Still, high winds accompanying summer showers cause widespread root lodging in many seasons, especially when manure or medium-to-high levels of N fertilizer are applied. Such fields cannot be machine harvested (a rare practice in the Mexican highlands) and even harvesting by hand is difficult.
â€¢
Yields may be greatly reduced when root lodging occurs during the period from just before to just after anthesis. For example, during 1988 in the Toluca Valley, one of the best farmers planted an improved variety with good management in. two large fields. In the unlodged field he harvested 6 tlha and in the badly lodged field slightly over 1 tlba

Oromiya was a logical first home for the improved highland maize. The expansive state spans parts of western, central and southern Ethiopia, and is home to 26 million people. Nearly 90% are rural folk who depend on agriculture.

### Europe

Europeans collected maize in the Americas from all elevations and took the seed to Europe for testing. Highland germplasm, especially Mexican highland germplasm, was well represented among the initial introductions grown in Spain during the late 1490s (Trifunovic 1977). It is possible that some of the cold tolerance in the European flints traces back to highland introductions. In recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in highlanp tropical maize among European maize breeders working at high latitudes with cool maritime climates. The recent availability of tropical highland inbred lines has greatly enhanced the probability of successful introgressions ofhighland maize into northern European maize genotypes. Important to CIMMYT is that "spin-offs" from this research are likely to be useful in the temperate highlands of developing countries. 

### Africa 
The introduction in Kenya in 1959 of Ecuador 573 (Gerhart 1975), a tropical highland transition 
zone maize, has had a great impact in Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and adjacent countries. 
CIMMYTsuccessfully introduced highland tropical maize in the highlands of Lesotho in the mid
1970s. Current efforts by CIMMYT to introduce true highland maize genotypes into areas where 
maize is not now grown may significantly improve African farmers' circumstances by increasing 
the diversity of suitable crops in zones now predominated by barley, wheat, potatoes, peas, pyrethrum, and broad beans. In tropical highland transition zone areas, selections from CIMMYT Pool 9A (late white semi-flint) have been or are being increased and made available to farmers in Burundi and Ethiopia, and the pool is used in breeding programs in Rwanda,Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Zaire, and Mozambique. Inbred lines from Pool 9A are being evaluated for combining ability in Kenya's tropical highland transition zone. Pool 9A is being converted to streak resistance at CIMMYT's research station in Harare, Zimbabwe. This is important since maize streak virus seems to be ~adually moving upward in altitude in Africa. 

### Asia

Asia CIMMYT is also introducing highland maize genotypes into Asia. A selection from Pool 9A has been increased for distribution to farmers in the tropical highland transition zone (mid-hills) of eastern Nepal, and Batan 8686 has been released to farmers in the highland tropics of Yunnan province, People's Republic of China. New materials are being tested in the mid-hills of the Himalayan zone in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, and Nepal.
