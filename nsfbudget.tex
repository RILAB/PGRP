\subsection*{Personnel}

%Salary compensation for senior project personnel is limited to no more than two months
%of their regular salary in any one year. This limit includes salary compensation received
%from all NSF-funded grants. This change moves away from the concept of summer salary
%and allows for reimbursement of two months of salary per year whenever appropriate during
%the year.

\subsection*{Other Personnel}
%Funds are requested to support one graduate student for 9 months
%during the academic year for each year of the project. At Arizona State University,
%the current pay rate for doctoral students at 50\% FTE is \$ during the academic
%year. Included is the estimated annual salary increase of 4\%.
%Brief description of students’ effort on the project should be provided.

\subsection*{Fringe Benefits}
Fringe benefits are applied to personnel salaries using the university approved rates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faculty - \% in FYs 2012, 2013, and 2014
\item Postdocs - \% in FYs 2012, 2013, and 2014
\item Graduate students - \% in FYs 2012, 2013, and 2014
\item Undergraduate students - \% in FYs 2012, 2013, and 2014
\item Staff - \% in FYs 2012, 2013, and 2014
\item Part time staff - \% in FYs 2012, 2013, and 2014

\emph{Graduate Student Tuition}

%graduate student employed on the project for 9 academic months at 50\% FTE, the tuition
%charge is \$ in FY 2012, \$ in FY 2013, and \$ in FY 2014.

\subsection*{Indirect Costs}
%Indirect costs are calculated on Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC)
%using F\&A rates approved by US Department of Health and Human Services.
%The University's rate agreement was established on April 30, 2007.
%Items excluded from F\&A calculation include: graduate student tuition remission,
%capital equipment, participant support, subcontracts over the first \$.
%F\&A rate of \% was used for this project.
