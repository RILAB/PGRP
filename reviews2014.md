# Panel Summary

## Intellectual Merit 

#### Strengths: 
The PIs proposed to study the adaptation of highland maize. An array of highland maize accessions and teosintes would be phenotyped and genotyped and candidate QTLs would be identified. The candidates would be further characterized by transcriptome profiling to study the response of the candidate genes to different environments. This proposal was aimed to answer an important biological question using the most up-to-date technologies. Dr. Ross-Ibarra has substantial experience in maize evolution and domestication, particularly in analyzing high throughput data and the panel felt the team is well assembled. 

#### Weaknesses: 
The panel discussed whether the requested budget is appropriate to the scale of the proposed project. 

### Broader Impacts 
Strengths: Overall the PI proposed excellent outreach activities including offering a public workshop aimed at enabling researchers to record and track data from large scale field trials. They would develop, release, and incorporate software into their teaching with the goal of providing students the tools to extract information from genomic data. The PIs will also capitalize on their previous experience running an international exchange program to organize a summer student exchange among members of the team, giving US students experience with large field experiments and Mexican students experience analyzing genomic data. 

#### Weaknesses: 
The approaches to recruit trainees for the phenotyping workshop were not described. 

## Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan: 
The postdoctoral mentoring plan is adequate. 

## Data Management Plan: 
The data management plan is adequate. 

## Summary and Rationale for Panel Rating: 
The PIs presented a logical plan to study local adaptation of highland maize in a genome-wide fashion, which is theoretically important and practically useful given its relevance to climate change and crop improvement. The genes identified in this study would be useful for development of maize lines that are suitable for non-tropical areas to meet the ever increasing demand for feed and food. The PI also proposed excellent outreach activities to train students and educate the research community in data record and analysis. 

This summary was read by the assigned panelists and they concurred that the summary accurately reflects the panel discussion.


## Panel Recommendation: 
Highly Meritorious

# Review 1: Excellent

#### Intellectual Merit:
The proposed research is directed towards investigating the genetic basis of highland adaptation in maize. Aims include; 1) dissecting the genetic architecture of highland traits, 2) investigation of population genetic signatures of highland adaptation, and 3) characterizing functional variation at adaptive QTLs. While directed towards highland adaptation, this project will greatly impact the broader area of plant local adaptation. This is a well-written proposal with sound experimental design. A highly capable, well resourced, research team is in place to perform the proposed research. 

#### Broader Impacts: 
This project will be broadly beneficial to the understanding of local adaptation and provide undergraduate students with research experience. Broader impact activities are well defined. The PI and CoPIs have a track record of delivering in these areas. 

#### Summary Statement:  

A well-written proposal by an outstanding scientific team that will provide insight into the nature of plant local adaption.

# Review 2: Excellent

#### Intellectual Merit:
the PIs asked important and interesting scientific questions about introgression, domestication and adaption, and proposed experiments are appropriate to answer the relevant questions. Dr. Ross-Ibarra has substantial experience in maize evolution and domestication, particularly in analyzing high throughput data. Given the amount of work proposed, the budget is very reasonable. 

#### Broader Impacts: 
the PI proposed excellent outreach activities including offering a public workshop aimed at enabling researchers to record and track data from large scale field trials; developing, releasing, and incorporating software into their teaching with the goal of providing students the tools to extract information from genomic data. The PIs will also capitalize on their previous experience running an international exchange program to organize a summer student exchange among members of the team, giving US students experience with large field experiments and Mexican students experience analyzing genomic data. 

#### Summary Statement: 

the genomic architecture of local adaptation in plant populations remains poorly characterized. The PIs presented a well integrated plan to study local adaptation in a genome-wide fashion, which is theoretically important and practically useful given its relevance to climate change and crop improvement. The PI also proposed excellent outreach activities to train students and educate the research community in data record and analysis.

# Review 3: Good

#### Intellectual Merit:

This proposal aims at identifying loci underlying plant adaptation to highland, which has apparently occurred multiple times in maize evolution. This is a very interesting question to address molecular basis of maize adaptation. 

They plan to carry out QTL mapping using two mapping populations in maize and teosinte, characterize the effects of a known polymorphism and do RNA sequencing. These approaches wii be amenable and productive, however, I concern creating admixture populations and NILs will take many years. 

#### Broader Impacts: 

The PIs propose international exchange program for students between US and Mexico, which is interesting. Organizing a phenotyping workshop is also proposed, that will be hosted by a co-PI in Columbia, MO. This is an interesting one too, but I was not quite clear who may be target attendees of this workshop. 

#### Summary Statement: 

Though this proposal deals with an interesting question, it may have limited outcome due to limited approaches proposed.

# Review 4: Very Good
#### Intellectual Merit: 

The genetic architecture of plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions is relatively unknown. Plant breeders will need to understand what genes are important for plant adaptation in order to contend with climate instability and to secure our food supply. 

The authors of this proposal will use high through put genotyping by sequencing to quickly map and identify genes important for maize adaptation in highland versus lowland environments. QTL of highland verus lowland traits using a synthetic maize population as well as natural populations will facilitate identification of altitude adaptation genes. 500 global accessions of highland adapted maize from different regions will also be genotyped as well as naturally occurring admixed maize populations that contain highland adapted teosinte genes. Association analysis and RNA seq will be used to fine map genomic regions and potentially identify the causative genes responsible for the adaptation phenotype. 

All of the researchers are well qualified to perform this type of analysis and have the necessary resources to carry out all of the proposed activities. In addition, they have chosen a good model system to carry out this research since maize has a wealth of genetic resources available and a large diversity of populations adapted to highland versus lowland environments. 

I have only a few reservations about how the researchers will be able to carry out all of the proposed experiments. For the identification of adaptation QTL between highland versus lowland maize, I was unclear on how the traits would be measured. For example, how will stem anthocyanin content be scored? Will the researchers use standard alcohol extraction, a huge undertaking when scoring thousands of plants? Has root chilling been shown to be a variable measurable trait in the highland versus lowland maize populations the researchers propose using? In figure three, both the GDP and GD traits were listed as germination depth, how do they differ? I felt that this section needed more detail. 

The researchers also propose comparing highland versus lowland teosinte populations. I found this aim problematic since, unlike maize which has experienced thousands years of cultivation, teosinte is a wild plant. Therefore, the selection pressures between the two are different, maize being selected for yield while teosinte selected for survival. Since the researchers are already analyzing naturally occurring admixed maize/teosinte lines, I found the analysis of the pure teosinte lines less compelling, and not relevant to the goal of securing crop yields. 

The researchers will also perform RNA seq to identify differentially expressed genes that may potentially narrow down QTL regions. This aim may prove to be technically difficult for a variety of reasons, including the inherent heterogeneity of the maize genome. For example, a simple comparison of expressed transcripts between the Mo17 and B73 backgrounds can reveal thousands of differences in the absence of any environmental challenge. Moreover, what criteria will the researchers use to distinguish adaptation specific genes? Will it be simply based on expression levels? From previous domestication studies, large expression differences between different populations may be rare. For example, the maize domestication gene tga does not show a large expression difference, and the causative mutation is due to a single amino acid change in the protein. In rice, the domestication locus qSH1 is caused by a single SNP in the promoter that does not lead to a large expression difference. While I believe that that his experiment is still worth doing, the analysis of the data may need more careful consideration. 

#### Broader Impacts: 

The researchers describe several activities designed to spread the knowledge generated from their proposal. This includes a scientific exchange program operated in conjunction with Mexican research institutes, as well as a phenotyping workshop run at Columbia Missouri. The researchers have run similar programs in the past and are well equipped to do so again. In addition, new software programs will be developed to analyze the large amount of data that will be generated. Finally, new germplasm accessions will be deposited with the USDA/ARS. All of these activities are well designed, and based on past results, have a high probability of success. 

Please evaluate the strengths and 
weaknesses of the proposal with respect to any additional solicitation-specific review criteria, if 
applicable 

#### Summary Statement: 

This proposal addresses a major area of scientific need, will create the tools necessary to analyze large data sets, will generate new germplasm resources, and will build research partnerships with Latin American countries. Although I believe the researchers have proposed a few experiments too many and may experience difficulties in subsequent data analysis, I feel their proposal merits funding.

# Review 5: Good/Very Good
#### Intellectual Merit: 

This proposal is focused on understanding the genomic basis for highland adaptation in maize. The investigators wish to use a series of QTL mapping experiments in different lowland/highland field locations to identify QTLs of interest. They will also examine admixture population genomics of teosinte across a lowland/highland contact zone and test for selection at QTL alleles in admixed populations. Finally, they will also examine phenotypic consequences of introgressed alleles and also use RNA-Seq to study gene expression differences that may be linked to adaptation in lowland/highland environments. 

This proposal is a nice comprehensive genomic examination of clear geographic adaptation in crops, a very important topic with regards to studying adaptation. The experiments and analyses are fairly straightforward and should yield information on the genetic basis for highland adaptation. Just a few comments on the plan: 

1. One aspect of the work is to look at lowland/highland adaptation in teosinte populations. I find that the connection to their main focus (adaptation in maize) does not appear to be strong. No doubt studying adaptation in teosinte would also provide insight into plant adaptation in general, but seems a little disconnected with the rest of the study. 

2. The RNA-Seq analysis seems a little superficial. This is clearly a discovery-based approach, and will likely provide some interesting genes. However, it is also fraught with issues û what tissues/organs to look at, at what developmental stage, etc. These issues cannot be helped, given the expense of these studies. However, a thoughtful discussion on this would have helped in ensuring that the limitations they face are clearly confronted. 

3. I had also wished they discussed at least some possible pitfalls they will likely face, given the ambitious scope of the proposal. This would at least provide a discussion (like in point 2 above) of the limitations of their study. 

#### Broader Impacts: 

The Broader Impacts are fine, including a research exchange with Mexico and a phenotyping workshop at Missouri. A weakness in this is that it was not clear how they would recruit participants in each. Will they focus on participants from their universities or advertise broadly? 

#### Specific Review Criteria:

The management and mentoring plans are well though-out. 

#### Summary Statement:  

In general, I like the focus of the proposal and am excited to see the outcomes, but there were areas that had insufficient detail to allow me to fully assess the proposed research and outreach. Nevertheless, these are seasoned investigators who have demonstrated in the past they can carry out the activities.
