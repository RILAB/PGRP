%Yearly research goals%Year 1:%Aim1: Presting: Annotate and release the sequence of centromeres 2 and 5. Anchor other centromere%contigs. Jiang: Carry out large scale CENH3 ChIP.%Aim2a: Birchler: Stock bulk, kinetochore staining to confirm genetic interpretations. Dawe: identify B%centromere markers for sequencing. Jiang: DNA methylation on super-stretched pachytene%chromosomes.%Aim2b: Dawe: Begin genetic and cytological analysis of tethered CENH3 and CENPC, build constructs%for tethering MIS12.%Aim3: Ross-Ibarra: collect Zea luxurians, score cSTS. Dawe: New centromere marker development%from Z. luxurians.
%Year 2:%Aim1: Presting: Validate and assemble FPC contigs, interpret CENH3 ChIP data, begin sequence finishing. Dawe: generate new TD markers for the centromeres targeted for completion.%Aim2a: Birchler: FISH/immuno-analysis of progenitor, inactive and reactivated lines. Jiang: fiber- FISH/DNA methylation mapping, confirm location of B centromere TD markers using B centromere deletion derivatives.%Aim2b: Dawe: Combination FISH / immunological assays on tethered CENH3 and CENPC lines.
