\textbf{Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan: }
\emph{Maximum of 1 page}
%Each proposal that requests funding to support postdoctoral researchers must include, as a supplementary document, a description of the mentoring activities that will be provided for
%such individuals. In no more than one page, the mentoring plan must describe the
%mentoring that will be provided to all postdoctoral researchers supported by
%the project, irrespective of whether they reside at the submitting organization,
%any subawardee organization, or at any organization participating in a
%simultaneously submitted collaborative project. Proposers are advised that the
%mentoring plan may not be used to circumvent the 15-page project description
%limitation.

\smallskip
%Examples of mentoring activities include, but are not limited to: career
%counseling; training in preparation of grant proposals, publications and presentations;
%guidance on ways to improve teaching and mentoring skills; guidance on how to
%effectively collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds and disciplinary areas;
%and training in responsible professional practices. The proposed mentoring activities
%will be evaluated as part of the merit review process under the broader impacts merit
%review criterion. Proposals that include funding to support postdoctoral researchers
%and do not include the requisite mentoring plan will be returned without review.

\bigskip
\textbf{Documentation of collaborative arrangements} of significance to the
proposal through letters of commitment.

\smallskip
%Proposers are reminded that, unless required by a specific program solicitation,
%letters of support should not be submitted as they are not a standard component
%of an NSF proposal, and, if included, a reviewer is under no obligation to review
%these materials. Letters of support submitted in response to a program solicitation
%requirement must be unique to the specific proposal submitted and cannot be altered
%without the author's explicit prior approval. NSF may return without review proposals
%that are not consistent with these instructions.

\textbf{Documentation regarding research involving the use of human subjects}, hazardous
materials, vertebrate animals, or endangered species.
